# Deep-Clustering-for-Automatic-Valence-Arousal-Recognition
A deep-cluster architecture automatically extracts and classifies features from physiological signals into emotional states.

main.ipynb shows how to use the deep cluster for automatic valence arousal recognition, and shows its accuracy on the WESAD benchmark dataset.
